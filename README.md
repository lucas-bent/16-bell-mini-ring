# 16-bell-mini-ring
This is a long term project being carried out by Lucas Owen &amp; Kye Leaver, involving designing and constructing a full-circle ring of 16 flower pots.

Bell 10 (OLIVER) bought at Copthorne Garden Center. Donor - Oliver E P Watson 30/04/2022
Bells now form a diatonic 4 with a sharp treble OR tuning (2-5) of 8.
Bell 9 (DAFFODIL) bought at B&Q along with a door knob which will be the clapper ball for bell 12. The bells now form a front 5 of an 8 meaning there is currently a true ring of 4. Notes are: F#,F,D#,C#,B.
06/05/2022, the treble nominal is 1479Hz F# -0cents which is too high pitched to fit into the rest of the ring. Tuesday just gone (3rd May 2022) Martin B Hough was contacted to ask the best way to tune a pot down.
6/05/2022. the treble was tuned by sanding the inside above the lip. The new nominal in 1462 = F# -20cents.
A true diatonic is now formed
Tuning now 1-5 of 8.
The found side of the door knob was sanded down to have a flat top. A wooden dowell was also sanded at the end to roughen it up. The two parts have now been glued together and just need to dry.

07/06/2022, the current treble has been inscribed and has been named DAFFODIL.

31/07/2022, the current 6th was donated by Fred Mills as a birthday present.

03/08/2022, the current 6th was weighed and measured. The weight of this bell is 5lbs 0.5oz and measures 11.00" in diameter. The nominal was analysed through wavanal: 928.5Hz - Bb-6

03/08/2022, the bells now form the tuning 1-6 of an 8.

**Frame:**
Potential 16 Bell frame layout created 23/04/2022. Did some design work looking at hanging the bells on one level, but have not yet thought of a 2-tier frame that would work.  We have considered hanging odds above and evens below (or vice versa) but this may lead to the bells on the top tier, especially the lighter ones, being very quiet, resulting in a sort of 'ding DING ding DING ding DING'. In which case, it may be a better idea to have the back bells on the uper tier, as they will be louder and more boomy anyway.
